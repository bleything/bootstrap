# Description

This cookbook installs [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
and replaces MacPorts as the *default package provider* for the
package resource on OS X systems.

This cookbook is now maintained by Opscode. The original author,
maintainer and copyright holder is Graeme Mathieson. The cookbook
remains licensed under the Apache License version 2.

# Requirements

## Prerequisites

In order for this recipe to work, your userid must own `/usr/local`.
This is outside the scope of the cookbook because it’s anticipated
that you’ll run the cookbook as your own user, not root and you’d have
to be root to take ownership of the directory. Easiest way to get
started:

    sudo chown -R `whoami`:staff /usr/local

Bear in mind that this will take ownership of the entire folder and its
contents, so if you’ve already got stuff in there (eg MySQL owned by a
`mysql` user) you’ll need to be a touch more careful. This is a
recommendation from the Homebrew

## Platform

* Mac OS X (10.6+)

The only platform supported by Homebrew itself at the time of this
writing is Mac OS X. It should work fine on Server edition as well,
and on platforms that Homebrew supports in the future.

# Resources and Providers

## package / homebrew\_package

This cookbook provides a package provider called `homebrew_package`
which will install/remove packages using Homebrew. This becomes the
default provider for `package` if your platform is Mac OS X.

As this extends the built-in package resource/provider in Chef, it has
all the resource attributes and actions available to the package
resource. However, a couple notes:

* Homebrew itself doesn't have a notion of "upgrade" per se. The
  "upgrade" action will simply perform an install, and if the Homebrew
  Formula for the package is newer, it will upgrade.
* Likewise, Homebrew doesn't have a purge, but the "purge" action will
  act like "remove".

### Examples

    package "mysql" do
      action :install
    end

    homebrew_package "mysql"

    package "mysql" do
      provider Chef::Provider::Package::Homebrew
    end

## homebrew\_tap

LWRP for `brew tap`, a Homebrew command used to add additional formula
repositories. From the `brew` man page:

    tap [tap]
           Tap a new formula repository from GitHub, or list existing taps.

           tap is of the form user/repo, e.g. brew tap homebrew/dupes.

Default action is `:tap` which enables the repository. Use `:untap` to
disable a tapped repository.

### Examples

    homebrew_tap "homebrew/dupes"

    homebrew_tap "homebrew/dupes" do
      action :untap
    end

# Usage

We strongly recommend that you put "recipe[homebrew]" in your node's
run list, to ensure that it is available on the system and that
Homebrew itself gets installed. Putting an explicit dependency in the
metadata will cause the cookbook to be downloaded and the library
loaded, thus resulting in changing the package provider on Mac OS X,
so if you have systems you want to use the default (Mac Ports), they
would be changed to Homebrew.

The default itself ensures that Homebrew is installed and up to date.
