= Description

Installs Homebrew and acts as the native package provider for Mac OS X using
Homebrew to install packages. See:

http://woss.name/2011/01/23/converging-your-home-directory-with-chef/

for additional background.

= Requirements

== Prerequisites

In order for this recipe to work, you will have to already own
<tt>/usr/local</tt>. This is outside the scope of the cookbook because it's
anticipated that you'll run the cookbook as your own user, not root and you'd
have to be root to take ownership of the directory. Easiest way to get started:

    sudo chown -R `whoami`:staff /usr/local

Bear in mind that this will take ownership of the entire folder and its
contents, so if you've already got stuff in there (eg MySQL owned by a +mysql+
user) you'll need to be a touch more careful.

== Platform

This is only going to work on platforms that Homebrew supports which is, I
think, just Mac OS X. This cookbook has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.6 with the
latest version of Homebrew (as of Mon 24 Jan 2011 at any rate!).

== Cookbooks

Shouldn't require any other cookbooks, though its operation may be greatly
enhanced by another cookbook I'm brewing that manages launchd. ;-)

= Resources and Providers

This cookbook provides a package provider called +homebrew_package+ which will
install/remove packages using Homebrew. This becomes the default provider for
+package+ if your platform is Mac OS X.

= Attributes

None.

= Usage

Just make sure that this cookbook is selected before you start installing
packages. You can add:

  include_recipe 'homebrew'

to all your recipes that install packages, or you can just make sure it's on
the run list somewhere early on. The cookbook itself ensures that Homebrew is
installed and up to date.
